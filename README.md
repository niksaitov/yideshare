This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Onboarding (dev server + prisma bootup)

First, run the development server with following commands in coding IDE or local terminal:

(first-time to install package dependencies)

```bash
npm install
```

Runs dev server on port 3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Open a second terminal window and input the following commands:

Sync with latest db changes or create if no db:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Test:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## Using Playwright:

```bash
cd playwright-tests
```

To run tests simple:

```bash
npx playwright test
